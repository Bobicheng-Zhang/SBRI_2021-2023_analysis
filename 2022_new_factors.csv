The extra fee to the state (and tracking of the fee) seems simple, but I don't have staff trained to help with all the changes. So it falls on me.

I'm still looking for work to supplement my income. These options don't apply to my small business.","Quick answer, at this point, nothing. It's already been destroyed.

For 25 years, my small business has been dependent on bands touring and playing live. When everything shut down, initially we all figured it would be for a few weeks or maybe a month. But because of the inaction taken at the federal level (aka the dumpster fire that was #45), the music industry (live touring) stayed shut down for about 18 months straight. Most of my clients were forced to pivot, so I lost 5 of my 6+ annual clients. They all said they planned to come back once bands were touring, but none have. So, I trusted what I was told, waited for them to return, worked odd jobs/projects for supplemental income, but used up all of my savings trying to survive in the meantime. But have actively been trying to find permanent work for the past 6 months. I have a very eclectic set of skills, I know I will be a great asset to anyone who gives me a chance, but no one has taken that leap so far. So, I will just continue to keep trying.

Covid destroyed my business of 25 years. I trusted and put faith in long term clients, when I obviously shouldn't have. The past few years have sucked.

Since we are renting, we are using a lot of money on the rent as we do not own the place. However if we had our own place of worship, we would spend money more on things that need to be fixed, little things, and not having to worry about spending a bunch of money on a large sum of money. Something else would also be a mode of transportation. A lot of believers/followers of the church need rides and most are not able to come to church every Sunday because lack of thereof. We only use a small car that can only take a certain amount of people. These two things would really help the church.",4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,43,Associate degree,,I do not identify with a disability or impairment,,,,,,,,,,Never served in the military,,,Black or African American,,,,,,,Male,,Man,,,,,,No,No,cityofgod29@yahoo.com,ECSBSS2022_6,Email Address,-2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,18.0,12.0,19.0,15.0,20.0,16.0,18.0,23.0,141.0

Without reliable employees, I am forced to shadow existing employees, a huge reduction in my productivity as a small business owner--and consequently a reduction in my ability to engage in forward looking activities for the business.  COST OF EMPLOYEES AND TRAINING:  Higher costs for unskilled labor is killing small businesses.  I know of no job training or incentive programs that are offered byDenver or Colorado to address this.  REAL ESTATE:  There has been no growth in the commercial real estate market in years, plus the higher cost of NNNs inDenver (and beyond), which limits our growth into new locations.  BUSINESS GROWTH: I believe there is plenty of opportunity to grow the business, but postponing action on that only invites newer entrants into the markets I serve, further reducing my growth potential.  FUNDING:  I could bring on at least 3 new suppliers and a private label program if I could fund starter inventories for this purpose.  OUTREACH:  I work 6 days/week--and have for the last 4 years--to keep my business going.  My time is largely preoccupied with the day-in-day-out activities of the business, not forward looking outreach, new locations and new brands.  SALES TAX: I also find the sales tax environment in Colorado to be unnecessarily time-consuming and complicated, a detriment to every small business in the State.

I still feel very hurt and poorly treated in regards to the Colorado arts relief grant that was created for people like me. REP, Amebilia referred us and recommended us for this grant because of this our program still suffers, and is working hard to regain our footing. So what would help is this… it would help to have people running the grant process that understand how it should be run and have certain limit set so that businesses that educate you through adult and give back to communities can receive these grant monies, even though we’re a small business and not a nonprofit. Unfortunately we’re seeing a lot of companies that don’t have overhead receive this grant and they also are putting on performances that are creating revenue for themselves where many of us just needed the revenue to survive to pay rent, electricity, etc..
