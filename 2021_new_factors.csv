Yes, we constantly adapt and change (that is the nature of our business), but it is honestly exhausting to think about another potential shut down. I am still digging out of debt and so the most beneficial program would be low cost capital that could be quickly available similar to the PPP last year. Without that we would have been gone. Digging out of debt has been difficult with increased costs and supply chain disruptions. But ultimately exhaustion and customers/new employees that are now becoming so entitled and difficult to work with does make one question, ""why are we doing this?"" ""Is it worth it in the end when we see profit margins slipping even more and the exhaustion that those us of dedicated to our field/craft are feeling?""

Because Colorado has all the makings of a great state for this industry, it's just sad that there's practically zero help for any developers who wish to live and create within the state. In 2019 the state lost one of its longest lived (native) game companies, Backflip Studios, without so much as a whimper. What would today have looked like if Backflip Studios could have managed some help in the form of grants or state aid?

However, as a small business in a rural setting, we are of little interest to major lenders. We are a hub for local craft-persons and artists and losing our venue would have a negative impact on these vendors (south-east Douglas, Elbert, El Paso, and Arapahoe counties), since craft fairs and similar arenas have been getting shut down over the past 18 months or so. With the resurgence of the delta coronavirus, both sides in the politicized debate over masks, vaccines, social distancing, etc, have retreated into their own bubbles and no longer want to sit for a simple conversation in a public coffee shop that might blow up into a confrontation. Our business model *had* been based on getting people into our shop for coffee & snacks or craft classes and then up-selling retail items. People just don't want to sit around in-doors chatting in a larger group any longer, This had been our mechanism for getting traffic into our shop, which is located remotely from any similar sort of business. Any approach that would ""go bigger"" or ""break the covid barrier"" would demand either (I think) capital investment in outdoor patio space or targeting one side or the other (pro- or anti- public health measures) and developing that as a brand. Honestly, this seems to be a trend lately in which bars or restaurants differentiate themselves by refusing or embarrassing customers who are masked or vaccinated, on the one hand, or refusing customers who are not masked or vaccinated. Neither of these seem to me to be sustainable business propositions, whether or not COVID kills you or shuts down your business. Perhaps in a couple of years, the bad taste of all of this will have been washed away; but until then, some form of active financial risk mitigation to save small business such as ours would be incredibly useful.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,51.0,Some graduate coursework,,I do not identify with a disability or impairment,,,,,,,,,,Never served in the military,,,,,,White,,,,Female,Woman,,,,,,,"No, but I identify as an Ally",adangus@me.com,,-1.0,-4.0,-4.0,2.0,0,14.0,12.0,13.0,17.0,16.0,12.0,16.0,20.0,120.0

With this new covid surge and some employers disallowing use of continuing education funds for Zoom conferences we expect sales to drop more this year. If we lose MORE money this year, we may need to close. Colorado will lose visitorship as a result.
